# Restaurant Review Scraper

A Python web scraper that extracts comprehensive restaurant information and reviews from TripAdvisor. This tool is designed to gather detailed data including ratings, reviews, contact information, and more. I followed a tutorial and added a comprehensive logging configuration that saves all program messages to both the console (for real-time monitoring) and a scraper.log file (for persistent record-keeping) with timestamps and proper formatting.

## Features

- üçΩÔ∏è **Comprehensive Data Extraction**: Restaurant details, ratings, reviews, and contact information
- üîÑ **Multi-page Scraping**: Automatically scrapes all available review pages
- üåê **Proxy Support**: Built-in proxy rotation to avoid rate limiting
- üìä **Detailed Ratings**: Food, service, value, and atmosphere ratings
- üìù **CSV Export**: Clean, structured data output
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic and exception handling
- üìã **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

## Data Extracted

### Restaurant Information
- Name, price level, cuisine type
- Overall rating and total review count
- Detailed ratings (food, service, value, atmosphere)
- Ranking and city information
- Address and phone number

### Review Data
- Individual review ratings
- Review titles and full text
- Review dates
- All reviews from all available pages

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-review-app.git
   cd restaurant-review-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up proxies (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   cp proxies.txt.example proxies.txt
   # Edit proxies.txt and add your proxy servers
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
python app.py
```

The script will scrape the default restaurant (Gallagher's Steakhouse in NYC) and save results to `tripadvisor_ny_restaurant_reviews.csv`.

### Customizing the Target Restaurant

Edit the `base_url` variable in the `main()` function:

```python
base_url = 'https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d478965-Reviews-Gallaghers_Steakhouse-New_York_City_New_York.html'
```

Replace with your target restaurant's TripAdvisor URL.

### Proxy Configuration

1. Create a `proxies.txt` file with one proxy per line:
   ```
   192.168.1.1:8080
   10.0.0.1:3128
   203.0.113.1:8080
   ```

2. The scraper will automatically rotate through available proxies.

## Output

The scraper generates a CSV file with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| RESTAURANT_NAME | Name of the restaurant |
| PRICE_LEVEL | Price range (e.g., $$$) |
| CUISINE_TYPE | Type of cuisine |
| TOTAL_RATING | Overall rating out of 5 |
| TOTAL_REVIEWS | Total number of reviews |
| FOOD_RATING | Food rating out of 5 |
| SERVICE_RATING | Service rating out of 5 |
| VALUE_RATING | Value rating out of 5 |
| ATMOSPHERE_RATING | Atmosphere rating out of 5 |
| RANKING | Restaurant ranking in city |
| CITY | City name |
| ADDRESS | Restaurant address |
| PHONE_NO | Phone number |
| RATING | Individual review rating |
| REVIEW_TITLE | Review title |
| REVIEW_DETAILS | Full review text |
| REVIEW_DATE | Date of review |

## Configuration

### Rate Limiting
The scraper includes built-in delays to be respectful to TripAdvisor:
- 3 seconds between individual reviews
- 8-12 seconds between pages (randomized)

### Retry Logic
- 3 retry attempts for failed requests
- Automatic proxy rotation on failures
- 5-second delay between retries

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This tool is for educational and research purposes only. Please ensure you:

- Respect TripAdvisor's Terms of Service
- Use reasonable delays between requests
- Don't overload their servers
- Consider using official APIs when available
- Be mindful of copyright and data usage policies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No proxies loaded**
   - Ensure `proxies.txt` exists and contains valid proxies
   - Check proxy format (ip:port)

2. **Request failures**
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check if proxies are working
   - Try with different proxy servers

3. **Empty results**
   - Verify the TripAdvisor URL is correct
   - Check if the restaurant has reviews
   - Ensure the page structure hasn't changed
